## Project Goal

The goal of the project is creating an Android Application to help drivers understand their driving behaviors.All data will be collected from vehicle and sensors by using OBD2 device and an Android smartphone. After that the system will send the data to our web server for analyzing the data, in order to determin if the driver drives the auto appropriately. The system could detest these driving behaviors,  full stop, hard break, exhibition speed, etc..
After analyzing the data, the system will give a report about their driving behavior based on the data we collected.

## Project Features

	* Collecting vehicle engine data(speed, RPM, engine working duration)
	* Collection position data(Latitude, Longtitud)
	* Upload data(upload data files to the server)
	* Driving behaviors report.

## Data Collection

* OBD2
	* Speed
	* RPM
	* Drving Duration
	* Engine Data
* Phone
	* GPS Location
	* Time
	* Google map Information
	* Accelerometer

## Project Design
	
The system structure of the project is show as Figure 1. The OBD2 device will connect with the userâ€™s car and collect data all information about the car, such as speed and engine information. The smartphone will connect the OBD2 by bluetooth, and the application will keep receiving the data about the car. Meanwhile, the application will also collect the data from the smartphone, such as position and direction, etc. After
collecting all data both from OBD2 and smartphone, the app will send the data to our web server. The web server will receive the data and start analyzing. Finally, the web server will give a report to user for helping drivers understand their driving behaviors.
